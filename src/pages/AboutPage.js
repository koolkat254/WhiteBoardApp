        <p>Welcome to our Whiteboard App! We were originally a school project that our teacher had assigned to us.</p>
        <p>This Whiteboard allows people to take photos of their art and drawings on a whiteboard. You are them able
        to send those photos on a digital whiteboard. Then the final product would be a digital whiteboard containing all of your drawings
        you had taken a photo of. You can also have your whiteboard enter a competition with another whiteboard made by another user. Other
        users will vote on which is the best one and the winnings will be posted in the "Results" page.</p>
